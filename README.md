Task 2 - Predicting customer buying behaviour\
In the contemporary digital landscape, customers wield unprecedented empowerment, granted by their unfettered access to an abundance of information at their fingertips. This transformative phenomenon has undeniably altered the traditional buying cycle, rendering it markedly distinct from its former self. Nowadays, relying on the hope that customers will impulsively purchase flights or holidays upon their arrival at the airport would prove futile. Instead, airlines must adopt a proactive stance, actively seeking to engage and entice potential customers well before they embark on their journeys. Embracing a responsive approach is no longer tenable, necessitating a shift towards a proactive and anticipatory customer acquisition strategy to remain competitive in this dynamic market.

This task involves building a high quality predictive analysis to predict the successful bookings using customers booking data.
